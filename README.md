# \# Meta-Time AGI (Relational Time)

# 

# Meta-Time is a \*\*relational clock\*\* where \*time flows when prediction error shifts meaningfully\*.

# Instead of assuming uniform physical time, we define a cognitive/relational time that increases under novelty, learning pressure, or distribution shifts.

# 

# \## Quickstart

# 

# ```bash

# pip install -r requirements.txt

# python demo\_sensor\_time.py

# python demo\_awakening.py

# python demo\_text\_time.py
