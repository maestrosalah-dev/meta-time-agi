# Meta-Time AGI (Relational Time)

Meta-Time is a prototype where **time emerges from meaningful prediction-error change**
(relational / observer-dependent time).

## Idea
Meta-Time defines a **relational clock**: *time flows when prediction error shifts meaningfully*.
Instead of assuming uniform physical time, we define cognitive/relational time that increases under novelty,
learning pressure, or distribution shifts.

## Install
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
