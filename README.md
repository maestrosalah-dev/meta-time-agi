## 🕰️ Project Status: Clock Stable

MetaTime has reached a **Clock Stable** milestone.

The relational clock core is now stable and validated through
multiple demos and scenarios:

- ✔ Relational age accumulation
- ✔ Temporal states (LIVING / STAGNANT / AWAKENING)
- ✔ Density-based time flow
- ✔ Observer-aware dynamics
- ✔ Deterministic and reproducible behavior

This version establishes MetaTime as a **foundational temporal core**,
not an application layer.

Further work will build *on top of this clock*, not modify it.

### Stable API
- `RelationalClock.tick(value)`
- `relational_age`
- `density`
- `TemporalState`

The clock is considered **conceptually closed** and **implementation-stable**.
