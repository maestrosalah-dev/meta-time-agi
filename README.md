# Meta-Time AGI (Relational & Meta-Time)

Meta-Time is a research prototype where **time emerges from meaningful prediction-error change**.
Instead of assuming uniform physical time, we define **relational time** that flows under novelty, learning pressure, or distribution shifts.

This repo contains:
- a minimal Meta-Time core (`metatime/`)
- demos (sensor stream, calibrated “awakening”, text stream)
- a PDF paper (see `paper/relational_time.pdf`)
- (v2) an extended clock with **meta-time, density, and curvature**
